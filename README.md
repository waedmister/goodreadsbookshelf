![Digital Bookworld Quote: "There is one book-focused start-up that has arguably had the largest effet on changing how people discover new books. Goodreads."](https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/about/headerImages/Press-Carousel-1-21afedacace4691d0531549a3460d906.jpg)

Founded in 2007 by Otis and Elizabeth Chandler with the intention of connecting members with good books to read. Members can create Virtual bookshelves and organize their books by and comment on what they have read, are currently reading, or want to read in the future. In addition, members can find new books to read by connecting with current and new friends to see their friends' favorite reads and comments their friends have made about these reads.  

Currently the site boasts that it has 50 million members and that its bookshelves contain 1.5 billion books and 50 million reviews.

## III. Creative Brief ##

#### Client Background ####

Very popular site with a huge global presence. Been in existence since 2007. 

#### Project Overview ####

Client wants to make website more visually appealing/culturally appropriate while balancing content. Many users all over the globe. 

#### Project Drivers ####

Client wants to increase the number of members in the <18 years age category. Many members have kids in the household but how many of these kids are members? 

#### Target Audience ####

Youth and then all user groups.
Create a more universal design that is image based to appeal to all users. 

#### Competitor Analysis & SWOT ####

##### Competitors include: #####

(http://goodereader.com/blog/e-book-news/the-best-book-review-sites-2015) 

- [Booklikes](http://booklikes.com/), much different design, Polish-based company. More visually appealing. 

- Book Review sites without social connecting component of Goodreads and Booklikes: 
    - [Omnivvoracious](http://www.omnivoracious.com/)
    - [Kirkus]()
    - [NPR](http://www.npr.org/sections/book-reviews/), [CBC](http://www.cbc.ca/books/)
    - [New York Times Book Review](http://www.nytimes.com/section/books/review)  
    
##### Strengths ######   
Very popular and used world-wide. 
Curious how profitable site is, ask co-founders for earnings report. Not a lot of competitition, only Booklikes. 

##### Weaknesses ######
Word heavy--reading content on website rather than books. 
See Tone and Perceptions below, some negative press from authors and members, safety issue from a woman's perspective. 
##### Opportunities #####
Good way to partner with school and community libraries and literacy organizations. 

##### Threats #####
Need Internet to use service. Largest group is the $0-50k, not actually accurate statistic. What level of income would allow use? Public libraries have computers, but what about rural settings where libraries are not easily accessible, Internet may not have fast enough speed to utilize web, but presence internationally, so would seem loads on slower systems? 

Word List:
- Books
- Literacy
- Reading is fundamental
- Author
- Publisher
- Critic
- Reviewer
- Community
- Social
- Friends
- Fun
- Endless list

    
#### Tone and Perception ####
There seems to be some negative press related to Goodreads from both an author and reader perspective. Amazon customer reviews ranked the site high amongst users. 

From: http://goodreadsucks.com/#war


Goodreads is a FOR-PROFIT business. It makes money by listing my books without my permission and letting Goodreads members rate them without reading them and providing that rating data to Amazon and god knows who else.

From: http://www.amazon.com/Goodreads/product-reviews/B005AKD836

89% of 1493 customer reviewers gave Goodreads a 3 star or higher rating; avg rating = 4.2/5 stars

Let’s be clear: you are not the first person to call me a feminist whore on Twitter. Maybe if you were, your words wouldn’t have such an impact. But when you’re the fifth in a day, or the hundredth in year, then maybe this isn’t about me overreacting — maybe this is about they way we use language to make discussion scary and inaccessible for women.

From:

There is no question that some authors think Goodreads should be shut down and wish that there were only “professional” reviewers left to review books and that readers should be allowed to only say good things about all products. And there’s no question that this type of action by Hale will lead to some reviewers/bloggers deciding that the hobby of blogging is simply too rife with complications to continue. Possibly that is the outcome that some want.


#### Targeted Message ####

Link with professional review sites like Kirkus and New York Times Book Reviews so that members can read reviews from multiple perspectives. Increasing readership and social connections through books/reading is the main purpose of the website. Again, targeting younger readers <18 to foster reading as an important daily activity. 

#### Project Specifics #### 

Visual overhaul of the website. Simplify and beautify! 

#### The Numbers #### 
TBA 

#### People involved ####
Co-founders, select group of authors, investors, and members who represent all demogrpahic sectors.
